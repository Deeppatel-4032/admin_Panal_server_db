# Admin Panel

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an admin panel that allows users to register, sign in, and manage their profiles. After logging in, users are directed to a dashboard displaying a personalized welcome message with their name. The admin panel also includes a profile page where users can view their personal details.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend server
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building routes and handling requests
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages
- **MongoDB/Mongoose**: Database for storing user information
- **Cookie-Parser**: Middleware for handling cookies to manage sessions
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware to parse incoming request bodies
- **Bcrypt.js**: For password encryption and user authentication

## Features
- **User Registration**: Users can register with encrypted passwords
- **User Login**: Session management using cookies ensures secure access to the system
- **Dashboard**: Displays a welcome message with the userâ€™s name after login
- **Profile Page**: Allows users to view their personal information
- **MongoDB Integration**: Stores user information like email, password, and name

## Project Flow
1. **Registration Page**: Users can register by providing their email, password, and profile details.
2. **Login Page**: Users log in with their credentials. Cookies are used to manage the session.
3. **Dashboard**: After successful login, users are redirected to a personalized dashboard displaying a welcome message that includes their name.
4. **Profile Page**: Users can view their personal details on a profile page.
